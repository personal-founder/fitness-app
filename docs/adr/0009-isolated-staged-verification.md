# ADR-0009: Verify the exact staged candidate in isolation

## Decision

Export indexed blob contents to an isolated temporary directory and bind evidence to candidate, parent, policy, lockfile, and versions.

## Context and drivers

Unstaged fixes can make a broken index appear valid when checks use the working folder.

## Scope

- Applies to this verification/policy implementation.
- Excludes unrelated application repair, publication, and remote protection changes.

## Options and rationale

| Option | Benefit | Cost or risk | Outcome and reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Implement the selected convention | Reproducible verification | Adds maintained tooling | Selected by user-approved plan |
| Keep manual/disconnected checks | Less setup | Drift and weak evidence | Rejected |

## Consequences

- Benefits: requirements and results become inspectable.
- Costs and risks: strict checks expose existing gaps and may block commits.
- Mitigation: preserve the strict gate and record actual failures instead of weakening it.

## Implementation and traceability

Never stash, stage, or overwrite user work. Reject conflicts, symlinks, and submodules until safe export support exists. Detect source/index changes.

## Verification

- Acceptance: Use temporary repositories proving staged/unstaged separation and stale snapshot rejection.
- Result: Local regression and implementation evidence recorded; see [implementation evidence](../changes/verification-implementation.md).
- Limits: Native builds and hosted CI must not be claimed passing without actual evidence.

## Reversal and revisit

- Reversal: use a successor ADR; restore prior local hook configuration where applicable.
- Revisit when: evidence shows this decision prevents safe, maintainable verification.
